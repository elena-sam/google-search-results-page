# Project Title
Google Search Results Page
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).


## Description

For this second, optional HTML/CSS project, the aim was to build the Google.com search results page.

The dropdown menus, form submissions, and hover-highlighting were to be ignored. I however chose to add the hover-highlighting effects.


## What I learnt (main takeaways)
	- For this project, I used the grid property twice: for the header elements, and the Top Stories section.

	- Unlike the first project, I inserted the search field in another div. It is this div that I styled, like they did for the real Google page.

	- For the navigation icons at the end of the page, I used Google's background image, created as many table cells as necessary, and then used the `background`. I got this technique, the value for this property, and the values for the `background-position` property from the Dev tools.
	I could not quite figure out how to add an anchor to those elements, though.




## Built With the Help of
Atom 1.24.0
Chrome and Mozilla Dev tools were used to identify some font sizes, colors, etc.
